# gSwitch

gSwitch allows control over the gpu on dual gpu macs. It also optionally gives a notification when the gpu changed.

## Install

Currently the only way to install is to build the source, however I will be adding a proper solution soon.

## FAQ

Why create this when the amazing [gfxCardStatus](https://github.com/codykrieger/gfxCardStatus) exists? Well it was kind of buggy and I thought the notification system was a bit too happy so I rewrote the program in swift and made a bunch of changes.

## Notes

Does not support macs older than 2011

Since I wrote this in about 3 days I'm sure there are going to be issues.
